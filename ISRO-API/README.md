# ISRO PEDIA

This repository contains a web application that allows users to search for ISRO Locations , about their satellites . The application is built using JavaScript and the ISRO API, and is designed to be fast, responsive, and user-friendly.

## How it Works

The application uses the ISRO API to search for data about isro rockets and satellites and their isro centers based on  the city. When a user submits a search query, the application sends a GET request to the API, which returns a list of matching data along with their other information. The application then renders the results using JavaScript and displays them on the page.
